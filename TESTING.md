## Code Validation
### PEP8
Tested all python code with the [PEP8 checker](http://pep8online.com/):
- Lines are too long in `setting.py`
![settings-validation](readme-files/code-validation/settings-validation.png)
- Lines too long in products `views.py`
![products-view-validation](readme-files/code-validation/products-view-validation.png)
- The issues (blank lines, line too long, whitespaces) are fixed and besides the 2 know errors above the code is clean without errors
